📊 Mobile Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

Welcome to my Mobile Sales Dashboard Project, created using Power BI and Excel. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of mobile phone sales performance, helping businesses track revenue, product trends, and growth across different cities and time periods.

The goal of this project was to turn raw sales data into actionable insights using interactive, visually appealing reports.

🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes mobile sales by focusing on key metrics such as:

✔ Total Sales and Quantity Sold
✔ Revenue Distribution by City
✔ Product Performance by Mobile Model and Brand
✔ Transactions Volume and Average Selling Price
✔ Payment Method Analysis and Customer Ratings
✔ Sales Trends over Time (Monthly, Yearly)
✔ Growth Comparison with the Same Period Last Year
✔ Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales Performance

All reports are fully interactive, allowing stakeholders to filter and drill down into the data to get specific insights.
